Part 1: Island scene (with keyboard controlled camera)

Controls:
Up/Down = (controls the Y position)
Left/Right = (controls X position)
W/S = (controls X rotation)
A/D = (controls Z rotation)
-/+ = (controls Z position)

GUI allows you to manipulate the displacement of the heightmap.

I was unable to complete this assignment as much as I hoped before the
deadline and will revisit it to improve it.

Part 2: Orange Peel + Snowflakes

GUI allows you to maniupulate the snowflake particle generation.

The orange peel was created using noise to modify the coloration and give it
a natural, noise based texture.
